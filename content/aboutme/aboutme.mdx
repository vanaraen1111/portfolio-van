<div style="text-align: justify">
I have an awe for technology. I am a humane developer. I can interact, I have emotions and I put passion in my work.
I am someone who is more into algorithm and flow (backend); rather than looking at the specifics and little details (UI) - you could say this is my strength and weaknesses.

Even so, as someone who do fullstack, I am capable to do both frontend and backend development (thanks to the experience I gained from my previous companies that I am working with)
On database side, my technical capabilities on that is pretty basic.

Even so..
I am a resourceful person. I take initiative to google / find out solutions available on the net. The same curiousity that I have since I was a child. From "how to cleanup system unit", to "how to clean registry keys" to "how to dual boot window". I do experiment on my old android phones too, by trying out new custom roms for the android phone on xda-developers.com

During my typical days of working, I am best working when I am not being micro-managed. I found my creativity flourished when given enough space to grow. I am someone who like optimization of process flow; rather than repeating the same old method that usually consume a lot of time.

Eventhough developing frontend code is not my strength, I have keep myself updated by catching up with with newer UI framework such as Bootstrap. I am someone who is conscious of the skills I possess and lacking, therefore I took the energy and time to fulfill the tech gaps in order to be a more well-rounded developer.

Being someone that is more analytical rather than the quick-thinkers, I somewhat slower than the other dev that typically code faster. However, I took great satisfaction on my work because I have expressed my creativity well rather than speed. Moreover, as a result, I produced more quality and less-bug codes :)

On working style, I don't consider myself as workaholic. During weekends, I spent a lot of time in solitary for self-reflection, weekly self-maintenance and spending my time with love ones. However, during working hours that I have, I am fully committed in ensuring my daily goals is reached.
